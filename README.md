# Couchbase-hackathon

This project was built during a 1 day, in person, hackathon at the Manchester Couchbase offices.

The brief was to create an app which would help to solve a real world problem - the only requirement was that we used Couchbase as our database.

Prior to this hackathon we had only encountered Couchbase in passing, the majority of our database experience involved Express and PostgreSQL. Luckily, we had a member of the Couchbase team with us to assist.

We decided to make an app to track fires in the Moors as we are aware of the growing problem of BBQ fires and the impact on the environment and the creatures that live there. We hoped that our app would help to track trends and allow fires to be tackled in a timely manner.

Main Learning Points:
- I learnt the value of a non-relational database. Having never used one before, it really opened my eyes to see how much easier it is to adapt the data that you want to store if you aren't tied into a specific table format.
- I learnt how similar the process of hooking up an express server to any database is, you just need know where to look and what you are looking for.
- I learnt a lot about connecting specifically to the Couchbase server and how you need to be specific in your request in order to access and use the data within a specific bucket.
- I learnt how to use the browser to get the user's latitude and longitude and submit it to the database.

This day was really valuable, I learnt a lot, met some fantastic people and really enjoyed working with people in person rather than online.

Our team consisted of me, another bootcamper and a member of Couchbase staff to help us when we needed him.

We worked very hard on this app and our efforts paid off as we were selected as the hackathon winners!
